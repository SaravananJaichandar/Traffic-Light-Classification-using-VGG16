# # Traffic-Light-Classification-using-VGG16
Classifiying the traffic light signals using the pre-trained model VGG16 using Transfer Learning

In this project, VGG16 model is used for classifying the traffic light signal images using transfer learning.

Fully Conneted layers are removed from the VGG16 and are freezed and new fully connected layers are appended on top of it for predictions.
